# Face-Detection-and-Recognition
This is model designed as part of my PS-1 project at NorthCorp Software Pvt Ltd. 

The main code file for the given model is in the opencv python notebook. 
The pickle files are the ones which contain the data and encodings for the images which are used to train the model. The folder archive contains images on which our model is trained.  

Once the model was trained, we need to convert the model into an API so that it can be used in Android mobile apps and also in any web development.
